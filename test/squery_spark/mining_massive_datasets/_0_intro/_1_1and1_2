1)data mining called in 1990s
  after big data its called
  data science

2)model or algorithm

  similar to
  1)knowledge representation + generic reasoning algorithm
  vs
  2)reasoning algorithm that embeds knowledge
  *but here we have data patterns and data algorithms

  model helps us understand how data relate
    for example group them on related groups
  algorithm helps us get the new data (after we know how data are related)

  sometimes we already understand enough how data relate, and
  we need an algorithm

  other times we don't have a clue how data are related, so we need
  to make a model first and then make an algorithm
  (if the model is good, algorithm can be simpler)

  For example netflix and movies
    the problem is so complicated to know before-hand what makes data related,
    so we need first to create a model
    the algorithmic only solution here, it will be bad idea, because we
    dont know how data relates

  I guess many times we need both
    1)discover relations (modelling)
    2)algorithm to use this relations

3)Modelling approaches

  1)summarize
    so we know for all cases but approximate
  2)separate
    so we know for few cases but more accurate

4)Feature Extraction

  Frequent Itemsets
    find parts of 1 item

    *item = eat burger
     parts = chesse+ketchup+meat etc

  Similar Itemsets
    find alternative parts of 1 item

    *item = eat burger
     alternative parts1  = heinz ketchup + mocharella cheese + ...
     aleternative parts2 = hellmans ketchup + gouda chesse + ....


  This way we can understand the parts of items
  and also what alternatives we can have

  *for example if i am making burgers it makes sense to have
   all burger parts close, and in each part to have all alternatives close
   to select

5)Bonferroniâ€™s Principle

  its says that if possibilities are too many
  i shouldn't try to find because i will lose time and wrong results

  For example i know that evil people meet to plan in a hotel.
  and i start to look at all hotels reservations
  It doesn't make sense

  Instead i should add much more createria to minimize the statistical error
