#progress- Part 1 done

1)transformations are lazy and they produce RDD's
  reduce computation (do all transofrmations in 1 iteration when possible)
  spark auto-optimizes it
2)actions trigger the evaluation
3)DAG the directed graph that shows the tranformations that applied

  i can see all jobs, and the DAG for each job(sparkcontext opens the port)
  http://localhost:4040/

4)RDDs are mostly for 1 member or a pair
  Dataframe can be seen as an RDD where each member is a vector(a row)

  i can do dataframe like work in RDDs but dataframes are more optimized
  and simple to work with when each member is a vector(a row)

5)Monoid

  in reductions i need my f to be monoids the reason is that
  spark is distributed so f works inside 1 partition, and then
  combines the results also, if no monoid => wrong results will happen

  for example mean(10, mean(30, 50)) != mean(mean(10, 30), 50)
  mean is not a monoid

  M = (T, f, Zero)

  T = a type
    f: (T, T) -> T
  f = monoid assosiative binary function(order of f applied to args doesnt matter)
    f(f(a, b), c) = f(a, f(b, c))
  zero element (neutral elemement,identity element)
       f(Zero, a) = a
       f(a, Zero) = a

  Example monoid functions

    +,*,concat,set-union

  Non monoid functions examples

    mean,-,division,median

6)One way to solve this problem is to use a temp monoid function to
  do the reduce, and when done then apply the not-monoid one

  Example of this if average of each pair
  i use a pair reducing to [sum,count]
  and when done the reducing i apply the median

7)Shuffle in group-reduce

  when i group by a key and i want to apply the function
  if data with that key are in different machines they need all to move
  to 1 server so i can do the function

  this moving of data is called shuffling

  1)sort data by key
  2)shuffle data so all data for 1 key in same server
